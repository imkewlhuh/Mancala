How to Play:
-Players take turns by choosing a space to move;
-Pick up all the pieces in the chosen space and move counter clockwise around the board, dropping a piece in each of the spaces that you pass. Your turn ends when you drop the last piece.;
-When one player empties all their spaces the game ends. All remaining pieces get added to their respective players' pot and the player with more pieces at the end wins the game.;
-If your turn ends in your own pot, you make take another turn.;
-If your turn ends in an empty space on your row, and the adjacent opponent space contains pieces, you may perform a capture. Collect your last placed piece and all the pieces in the adjacent opponent space and add them to your pot.;
